        The Maldives (/ˈmɔːldiːvs/, US: /ˈmɔːldaɪvz/ (About this soundlisten);
        Dhivehi: ދިވެހިރާއްޖެ Dhivehi Raajje), officially the Republic of
        Maldives, is a small island nation in South Asia, situated in the
        Arabian Sea of the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and
        India, about 700 kilometres (430 mi) from the Asian continent's
        mainland. The chain of 26 atolls stretches from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in
        the north to Addu Atoll in the south to the equator. Comprising a
        territory spanning roughly 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), the
        Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed sovereign
        states as well as the smallest Asian country by land area and
        population, with around 515,696 inhabitants. Malé is the capital and the
        most populated city, traditionally called the "King's Island" where the
        ancient royal dynasties ruled for its central location.[12] The Maldives
        archipelago is located on the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, a vast submarine
        mountain range in the Indian Ocean; this also forms a terrestrial
        ecoregion, together with the Chagos Archipelago and Lakshadweep.[13]
        With an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above
        sea level,[14] it is the world's lowest-lying country, with even its
        highest natural point being one of the lowest in the world, at 5.1
        metres (17 ft).[14] In the 12th century Islam reached the Maldivian
        archipelago, which was consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong
        commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the
        mid-16th-century the region came under the increasing influence of
        European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British
        protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965,
        and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected
        People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability,
        efforts at democratic reform,[15] and environmental challenges posed by
        climate change.[16] The Maldives became a founding member of the South
        Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is also a member
        of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of
        Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank
        classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.[17]
        Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and
        remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing
        tourism industry. The Maldives rate "high" on the Human Development
        Index,[11] with per-capita income significantly higher than other SAARC
        nations.[18] The Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth from July
        1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest
        at allegations by the other nations of its human-rights abuses and
        failing democracy. The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February
        2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and
        popular support.
